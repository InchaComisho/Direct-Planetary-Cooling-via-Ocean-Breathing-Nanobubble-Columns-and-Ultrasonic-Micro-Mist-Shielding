Abstract

This whitepaper introduces a fully deployable, modular and low-risk climate-cooling system combining:
	1.	Ocean-Breathing System (OBS):
Nanobubble-based deep-ocean aeration restoring vertical mixing, nutrient upwelling and phytoplankton-driven CO₂ fixation.
	2.	Ultrasonic Micro-Mist Cooling (UMC):
High-frequency ultrasonic atomizers generating 2–10 μm droplets, forming a transient evaporative cooling layer on the ocean surface.

Together they enable direct, safe and reversible planetary heat reduction without atmospheric chemistry modification, artificial aerosols, or geoengineering risks.

All hardware components are mass-manufacturable with existing technologies.

1. Introduction

The Earth system has entered accelerated warming due to:
	•	Ocean thermal inertia
	•	Increasing SST-driven extreme weather
	•	Decline of carbon sinks
	•	Ocean stratification and biological collapse

Mitigation alone cannot reverse the accumulated heat.
A direct thermal intervention is required.

However, existing proposals (SAI, MCB, geoengineering) carry severe risks.

This paper proposes a nature-aligned alternative:
a distributed, modular, reversible cooling system using only water and physics.

2. System Architecture

2.1 Ocean-Breathing System (OBS)

Mechanism:
Nanobubbles injected at 200–1500 m depth rise slowly, dissolving oxygen and inducing controlled vertical mixing.

Objectives:
	•	Restore weakened thermohaline circulation
	•	Increase nutrient upwelling
	•	Stimulate phytoplankton growth
	•	Enhance biological CO₂ fixation

Nanobubble specifications:

Size: 100–1000 nm  
Lifetime: hours to days  
Generation: swirl-flow nanobubble injector  
Power: 300–600 W/unit  
Depth: 200–1500 m  
Flow rate: 30–80 L/min  


⸻

2.2 Ultrasonic Micro-Mist Cooling (UMC)

Mechanism:
2–10 μm droplets evaporate instantly, absorbing latent heat and reducing net surface heating.

Ultrasonic frequency: 1.65–2.4 MHz  
Droplet diameter: 2–10 μm  
Power requirement: 400–1500 W  
Mist density: 10⁵–10⁶ droplets/cm³  
Cooling flux: up to 670 W/m²  


⸻

2.3 Floating Modular Platform

A shared platform powers both systems.

Solar PV: 1.2–2.0 kW  
Vertical-axis wind turbine: 300–500 W  
Battery: 10–20 kWh LiFePO₄  
Platform type: HDPE octagonal float  
Mooring: modular flexible tether

3. Combined Effects
	•	SST reduction: 0.8–1.6°C (regional, cumulative)
	•	CO₂ fixation: 5–12 GtCO₂/yr potential
	•	Reduced cyclogenesis
	•	Stabilized atmospheric moisture transport
	•	Recovered marine ecosystems

The system is fully reversible: stopping operation returns baseline within days.

4. Deployment Strategy

Phase 1: Pilot (10 units)

Near-shore controlled deployment with full monitoring.

Phase 2: Regional (1,000 units)

Covering 3,000–7,000 km².

Phase 3: Large-Scale (100,000 units)

Targeting Indo-Pacific warm pools and key SST drivers.

⸻

5. Safety & Risk Assessment
	•	No chemical additives
	•	No atmospheric modification
	•	No aerosol injection
	•	No long-term persistence
	•	Fully reversible
	•	Localized effects only
	•	Compatible with marine ecosystems when operated with nutrient-flux limits

This system does not meet any definition of geoengineering.

⸻

6. Conclusion

Direct Planetary Cooling using OBS × UMC represents:
	•	A safe
	•	Scalable
	•	Immediately deployable
	•	Nature-compatible
	•	Open-source

method of addressing the core driver of climate destabilization:
oceanic heat accumulation.

All components exist today, and the design is fully open to humanity.
